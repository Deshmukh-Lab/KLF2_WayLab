Code used for data analysis in "Commensal microbe induced intestinal inflammation averted by Kruppel-like factor 2 expressing CD4+ T cells", Shao et al., unpublished.

You will find the code used for analysis on the main repository page: the code used for the murine scRNAseq analysis seen in Fig. 1 is in the .R script titled "sc_mouse_TJ_GitHub_SSW.R". The code used for the human CD and UC scRNAseq analysis is in the .R script titled "sc_human_JS_GitHub_SSW.R". 

Select data can be found in the "Selected data" subdirectory within the main repository. This includes two files: exp.filtermerge.csv, which is the murine scRNAseq data and UMAP_metadata_Extended_data_8_9.csv, which is the reference UMAP metadata used to create Extended Data Figures 8 and 9. All human scRNAseq data can be found in their respective citations.
